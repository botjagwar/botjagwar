== Installation ==

Launch the command 'make all'. That will install required dependencies among which Python, Pywikibot, Python MySQL
and MySQL server. It will also install the database schema and fill it with enough data to work.

== Configuration ==

Once you're done with 'make all', do the manual configuration by setting up the pywikibot.
See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/user-config.py for further details on how to configure Pywikibot.

You can change the default password by editing the makefile (*before* you start the install).
That initial password will be stored in clear at 'conf/BJDBModule/database_password'. To change your password
you'll have to manually do so by editing the stored password and by changing it inside MySQL itself.
